# Bey2ollak-Stream-to-Json
It parse the data from bey2ollak into json

the data avaliable here in the website http://desktop.bey2ollak.com/  but they don't provide any API to parse it so I tarce the stream and get the xml file but I like json so I create a script to make it easy to get a clean steam you can use it from here http://bey2ollak-mahrous.rhcloud.com/
